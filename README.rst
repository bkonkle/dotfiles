Brandon Konkle's Dotfiles
=========================

These are my terminal configuration files.  They've been gathered from various sources over time, and you're free to copy and change.

The Rakefile is taken from ryanb's dotfiles, and the script to read bash completion definitions from the directory comes from rtomayko's dotfiles.  Much of bashrc comes from Ubuntu.

Installation
************

::

    git clone git://github.com/bkonkle/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    rake install
